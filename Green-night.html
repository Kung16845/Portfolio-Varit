            <h2>About Game Project</h2>
            <p>It is a survival and base defense game where players must manage resources wisely, 
                create equipment, and employ planning and strategies such as scavenging, crafting, 
                and trading to ensure their survival.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        
        <ul class="learning-list">
            <p> I have developed coding skills related to managing various systems as follows: </p>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/Green-Night/tree/Varit/GreenNight/Assets/Script/Build%20System"
                    target="_blank" class="learning-link">Building Manager</a> <p>
                        I have designed and developed a system that can create structures in three sizes: small, medium, and large.
                         Each size requires different resources and construction time,
                         which means players need to plan their resource usage and time management efficiently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/Green-Night/tree/Varit/GreenNight/Assets/Script/Manager/Time"
                    target="_blank" class="learning-link">Time Manager</a> <p>I have developed a day and time counting system in the game,
                         which works in conjunction with the construction system. Different buildings will take varying amounts of time to construct. 
                        dditionally, the system is connected to resource management that can be used for in-game trading.</p>
            </li>
            <p> This project has helped me practice complex system coding skills and efficiently integrate multiple systems to work together.
                 Although the coding in this instance may not be perfect in terms of Clean Code,
                 I am committed to continuously improving my coding skills to make the code more organized, 
                 easy to understand, and suitable for team collaboration.</p>
