            <h2>About Game Project</h2>
            <p>The game will provide a tense survival experience where every problem encountered will always have multiple solutions. 
                It emphasizes providing an immersive experience, allowing players to be absorbed in the game's fearful and untrustworthy atmosphere.
                 When players succeed in something or overcome an obstacle, they will experience a moment of relief. 
                 However, this relief is temporary because the enemies haven't disappeared;
                 they've just retreated to hide and will certainly return. Exploring the scenes will give players more ways to survive.
            </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>



        <ul class="learning-list">
            <p> I have developed coding skills related to managing various systems as follows:</p>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/GDM320/tree/main/ProjectEva/Assets/Script/StageMachine"
                    target="_blank" class="learning-link">State Machine</a> <p>I have designed and developed a 
                        State Machine system along with the NavMeshPlus Package to help create the shortest path for enemies to efficiently 
                        chase players throughout the game. This system controls AI actions, consisting of 5 states: <br>
                <br><Strong>State Hunting :</Strong>  AI will chase the player when detected.
                <br><Strong>State Listening :</Strong> AI will listen for the player's footsteps and move towards the AI nest closest to the player.
                <br><Strong>State Retreat :</Strong> AI will retreat when its health drops to a specified level.
                <br><Strong>State Searching :</Strong>  AI will search for the player at various points in nearby rooms.
                <br><Strong>State SearchingSound :</Strong> AI will move towards the point where a sound is generated by the player's actions.
                <br>
                <br>This system enhances the challenge and realism of AI in the game by employing multiple strategies to track and pursue the player.

                <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/GDM320/tree/main/ProjectEva/Assets/Script/Inventory"
                    target="_blank" class="learning-link">Inventory Manager</a> <p> I have designed and developed an Inventory Manager 
                        system that allows players to efficiently manage their items. 
                        Players can easily store, move, and swap items. This system includes separate storage slots for various equipment, 
                        including:ก่ <br>

                        <br><Strong>Hand slot :</Strong> For items that players can use immediately in the game
                        <br><Strong>Flashlight slot :</Strong> For flashlights that provide illumination during gameplay
                        <br><Strong>Bag slot :</Strong> For storing items that players collect<br>

                        <br>This system is designed to enhance convenience and streamline the use of various equipment within the game.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/GDM320/tree/main/ProjectEva/Assets/Script/SaveAndLoadGame"
                    target="_blank" class="learning-link">Save Manager</a> <p> I have developed a Save Manager system for saving and loading game data using JSON files, 
                        allowing players to resume their game progress.</p>
            </li>
            <p> This project helped me learn how to manage complex code and integrate various systems such as State Machine, 
                Inventory Manager, and Save Manager. These experiences made me realize the mistakes that can occur due to inadequate planning.
                 What I learned is the importance of careful planning in coding. 
                 Lack of proper planning can lead to messy code that is difficult to understand. 
                 Working on this project has made me aware of the need to develop Clean Code concepts for use in future projects.</p>
