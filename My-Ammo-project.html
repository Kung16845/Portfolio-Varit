    <h2>What I learned</h2>



    <ul class="learning-list">
        <p>I have developed coding skills related to managing various systems as follows: </p>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/My-Ammo-Project/tree/Ta_Gamedesign/My%20Ammo%20Project/Assets/LoginManager"
                target="_blank" class="learning-link">CO-OP Manager</a> <p> I have designed and developed a 
                    Co-op system that allows players to join and play together through a Lobby. 
                    The Lobby window displays a list of all players, and includes a feature where only the Host can press the start game button.
                     Additionally, there is a Ready button for all players to indicate they are prepared before the game begins. 
                     This system was developed using NetCode.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/Kung16845/Green-Night/tree/Varit/GreenNight/Assets/Script/Manager/Time"
                target="_blank" class="learning-link">Spawner Manager</a> <p> I designed and developed the Enemy Spawner and Item Spawner systems for co-op gameplay. 
                    The Enemy Spawner system is responsible for randomly generating enemy spawn points at specified intervals, 
                    increasing the challenge for players. Meanwhile, the Item Spawner system randomly places items at various locations 
                    on the map for players to collect and use in combat.   
                    These systems add variety and excitement to the gameplay experience.</p>
        </li>
        <p> This project allowed me to learn and understand the development of co-op games, 
            especially the use of NetCode in managing multiplayer systems. 
            I learned about the importance of considering various factors that affect the player experience, 
            such as latency, which impacts the game's smoothness, real-time data processing, 
            and map updates when changes occur in the scene. These insights made me realize the complexity of issues in developing games 
            that support multiple players and helped me plan my coding more efficiently for future projects.</p>
